# Stripe Payment Integration - Sparks AI Chatbot

## Overview
A payment system has been integrated into the Sparks AI chatbot that requires users to pay after 3 free messages.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Modal (`StripePaymentModal.tsx`)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/StripePaymentModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful, modern payment form with Stripe-like design
  - Credit card input with automatic formatting
  - Expiry date and CVV validation
  - Email and cardholder name fields
  - Security notice with lock icon
  - Processing state with loading animation
  - Responsive design
  - Price display: $9.99 for unlimited access

### 2. Payment Integration in SparksChat
- **Location**: `frontend/src/pages/SparksChat.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Free message limit: 3 messages
  - Message counter displayed in header
  - "Upgrade" button in header for easy access
  - Payment modal triggered when limit reached
  - Premium access badge after payment
  - Unlimited messages after payment

## User Flow

1. **Initial State**: 
   - User starts with 3 free messages
   - Message counter shows in header: "3 free messages left"
   - "Upgrade" button visible in header

2. **During Free Usage**:
   - Counter decreases with each message sent
   - "2 free messages left" → "1 free message left"

3. **Limit Reached**:
   - After 3rd message, payment modal automatically appears
   - User can also click "Upgrade" button anytime
   - Input is disabled until payment or modal close

4. **Payment Process**:
   - User fills in payment details:
     - Email address
     - Cardholder name
     - Card number (auto-formatted with spaces)
     - Expiry date (MM/YY format)
     - CVV (3-4 digits)
   - Click "Pay $9.99" button
   - Processing animation shown (2 seconds simulation)

5. **After Payment**:
   - Success message from Sparks AI
   - Header shows "✨ Premium Access"
   - Unlimited messages enabled
   - No more payment prompts

## Current Implementation Note

⚠️ **This is a DEMO implementation with simulated payment processing.**

The payment form is fully functional but uses a **2-second timeout** to simulate payment processing instead of actual Stripe API calls.

## Next Steps for Production

To implement real Stripe payments:

1. **Install Stripe Package**:
   ```bash
   npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
   ```

2. **Set up Backend Endpoint**:
   - Create payment intent endpoint in your FastAPI backend
   - Add Stripe secret key to environment variables

3. **Replace Mock Payment**:
   - Replace the `setTimeout` in `handleSubmit` with actual Stripe Elements
   - Use `stripe.confirmCardPayment()` for real processing

4. **Add Payment Verification**:
   - Store payment status in backend database
   - Verify payment status on page load
   - Use JWT tokens or session to maintain paid status

5. **Add Security**:
   - Never store card details
   - Use Stripe's secure Elements for card input
   - Implement webhook handlers for payment events

## Testing the Integration

1. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Sparks Chat**:
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Go to Sparks Chat page

3. **Test Free Messages**:
   - Send 3 messages
   - Observe counter decreasing

4. **Test Payment Modal**:
   - On 4th message attempt, modal appears
   - Or click "Upgrade" button
   - Fill in mock card details (any valid format works)
   - Click "Pay $9.99"
   - Wait 2 seconds for "processing"
   - See success message and premium access

5. **Test Unlimited Access**:
   - After payment, send unlimited messages
   - Header shows premium badge
