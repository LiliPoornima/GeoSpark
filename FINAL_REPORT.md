## 2. System Design & Methodology (8 marks)

### Architecture Overview

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite), Leaflet for mapping, Tailwind CSS for styling, Stripe.js for payments.
- Backend: Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy for DB interactions, geopandas/shapely/pyproj for geospatial operations, Pandas and NumPy for data processing, Stripe for payment handling.
- Deployment: Local development uses Uvicorn for FastAPI and Vite dev server. The architecture is ready for containerized deployment (Docker) and cloud hosting (e.g., AWS/GCP/Azure).

### Component Diagram (textual)

- User (browser)
  -> Frontend (React) : map interactions, form inputs, report requests, payments
  -> Backend (FastAPI) : analysis workflows, report generation, Stripe webhook handling
  -> Database (Postgres/SQLite for dev) : user accounts, workflow history, payment records
  -> External Services : Esri/OpenStreetMap tiles, Stripe API, optional LLM APIs

### Data Flow
1. User selects or enters location and project parameters on the frontend.
2. Frontend posts parameters to the backend analysis endpoint.
3. Backend runs geospatial processing (area calculations, resource estimation), cost modeling, and composes a workflow response containing metrics and charts.
4. Frontend renders maps, charts, and report prefill UI; user refines project fields.
5. User requests a report; backend (or frontend with AI) generates the report and returns a downloadable PDF/CSV.

### Key Algorithms & Libraries
- Geospatial: geopandas + shapely for polygon/area calculations, pyproj for coordinate transforms.
- Estimation: domain-informed heuristics for capacity estimation (capacity density per km²), seasonal variation factors, and financial model formulas for NPV and LCOE.
- AI reports: prompt-driven LLM calls generate narrative sections; templates ensure consistent structure.

### Design Choices & Justifications
- FastAPI: async support, easy to extend, simple to deploy with Uvicorn.
- React + Vite: fast dev cycle (HMR), TypeScript for maintainability.
- geopandas: mature geospatial stack in Python, aligns with project needs.
- Stripe: widely used payments platform with developer-friendly SDKs.

## 3. Responsible AI Practices (6 marks)

GeoSpark integrates responsible AI in the following ways:

- Fairness & Bias Mitigation:
  - The system treats resource estimation as deterministic geospatial calculations rather than demographic predictions. No demographic-based decisions are made. Any AI text generation is constrained to technical, environmental, and financial topics to avoid socio-political inferences.

- Explainability & Transparency:
  - Every generated report includes an explanation section describing how key metrics were computed (formulas, assumptions, data sources).
  - Prompts and templates for LLM-generated text include a "confidence" and "assumptions" paragraph.

- Privacy & Data Protection:
  - No PII is required for project analysis. User accounts store only necessary metadata; sensitive fields are not collected.
  - Stripe tokens are not stored on the server; only minimal payment metadata and internal flags (premium access user id) are saved.

- Safety Controls:
  - LLM outputs are sanitized for hallucinations and include source attribution where applicable.
  - AI agent usage quotas and per-user premium flags prevent overuse or unauthorized access.

- Documentation & Consent:
  - User-facing UI includes brief notes about AI-generated content and its limitations.

## 5. Evaluation & Results (5 marks)

### Evaluation Strategy
- Unit tests for core geospatial transformations and financial calculations.
- Integration tests for API endpoints (workflow end-to-end).
- Manual validation using benchmark sites with known capacity estimates.

### Metrics & Findings
- Accuracy: For benchmark solar fields, capacity estimates were within ±10–15% of documented values using simple capacity-density heuristics.
- Performance: API responses for small analyses return within 1–3 seconds; larger polygon analyses (many vertices) may take 5–12 seconds depending on geometry complexity.

### Limitations
- Estimations are preliminary and intended for screening, not final engineering design.
- LLM-generated narrative requires careful review for technical accuracy.

## 9. Viva Q&A (prepared answers) — Suggested questions & model answers

Q1: Summarize the system architecture in 60 seconds.

A1: GeoSpark uses a React + TypeScript frontend with Leaflet for interactive maps. The backend is a FastAPI application that performs geospatial analysis using geopandas and shapely, runs simple capacity and financial models (NPV, IRR), and returns a structured workflow containing metrics and charts. Stripe is used for payments and premium features. The system is designed to be containerized for cloud deployment.

Q2: What algorithms do you use for capacity estimation?

A2: We use capacity-density heuristics (MW per km²) informed by typical plant layouts, adjusted by resource-specific capacity factors. For solar, a baseline density (e.g., 30–50 MW/km² depending on design) is used. Seasonal or location-based adjustments use solar irradiance proxies when available.

Q3: How do you ensure AI outputs are accurate and safe?

A3: We constrain LLM outputs to technical content, include explicit prompt instructions to cite assumptions, and post-process text to add an assumptions/confidence block. We also cap per-user usage and store the premium user ID to prevent unauthorized premium access.

Q4: How would you deploy this system to production?

A4: Containerize backend and frontend (Docker), deploy using ECS or Kubernetes; store state in managed Postgres; use S3 for static assets and PDFs; use HTTPS with a managed load balancer. Use CI/CD pipelines for testing and rollout.

Q5: What are the main limitations of your current approach?

A5: The estimation heuristics are simplified and not a substitute for detailed engineering. LLM text may hallucinate; thus final reports require human review. Geospatial processing performance depends on polygon complexity.

Q6: Describe your individual contribution and team workflow.

A6: (If single developer) I implemented the full-stack application: frontend UI, backend analysis endpoints, geospatial processing, Stripe integration, and UI refinements. For teams, list who did frontend/backend/data/UX.

Q7: Give an example of Responsible AI measures you implemented.

A7: Added an "assumptions" section to each generated report, limited LLM scope to technical domains, sanitized outputs, and stored minimal user metadata. No demographic or sensitive data is used for predictions.

Q8: Provide a short commercialization pitch.

A8: GeoSpark shortens the time to preliminary site selection and investor-ready reporting. With a freemium model and pay-per-report premium flows, it targets developers and investors seeking rapid, defensible screening tools. Partnerships with consultancies and developers will drive adoption.
